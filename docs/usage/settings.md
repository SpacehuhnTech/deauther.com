## Changing Settings (Serial)

:::info
You need a serial connection for this one. See [Serial Interface](/docs/usage/serial) for more info.
:::

1. Open a Serial Terminal of your choice (for example [serial.huhn.me](https://serial.huhn.me))
2. Connect your Deauther/ESP8266 Board (115200baud, \n)
3. To view your current settings type `get settings`
4. To change a setting, use the set command. For example: `set password "my new cool pswd"`
5. To save your settings type `save`
