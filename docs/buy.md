## Others

:::caution
You can find many other Deauthers online too. Those, however, are not officially supported and do not contribute to the development of this project!  

**Please do not support people whose entire business is built upon taking advantage of open-source projects.**

If you want to save money, I recommend you build one yourself! You only need an ESP8266 Development board, a USB cable, and a computer. See [supported devices](http://localhost:3000/docs/diy/supported-devices) for details.
